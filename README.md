**Target:**

  * Functions

_We will start to get familiar with the control structures of Python_

# Exercise 1
- The exercise wants to create a program that rates a numeric variable based on the Suspended / Passed / Notable / Excellent scale.

# Exercise 2
- Using the following Programiz tutorial: Python Input, Output and Import create a program that asks you two numbers. It should show you a message saying if the first one is bigger, the second one is bigger or they are the same.

# Exercise 3
- Create a program that asks you for your name, and asks you for a number. If the number is 0, it should display an error message. Otherwise, it should display the repeated name as many times as the number indicates. For example, “Joan Joan Joan”.

# Exercise 4
- Create a program that given any list, tells you if it is symmetrical or not. If so, let me tell you how many items it has.

# Exercise 5
- Create a program that given a list, tells you how many numbers match your position. For example [3,4,2,0,2,3,6] 2 and 6 coincide.
